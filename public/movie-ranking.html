<h3><u>Jarhead</u></h3>
<h4><p>I loved this movie because unlike other military movies, it wasn't all about the combat itself, but more about the effects of comabt and training has on a soldiers mind.<br /> Which I thought was depicted really well!</p></h4>

<h3><u>The Wolf of Wallstreet</u></h3>
<h4><p>This movie was just all around goofy and had just some great actors for the roles of these carefree, rich, young, entrepreneurs.<br />
One of which was Leonardo DiCaprio who I just really enjoy as an actor.  
</p></h4>

<h3><u>The Gentlemen</u></h3>
<h4><p>The Gentlemen is one of my favorites beacuse its comedic british gangster Guy Ritchie movie.<br /> Personally I like a lot of Guy Ritchies movies but The Gentlemen is definitely my all time favorite and I just love the way he filmed it.</p></h4>
