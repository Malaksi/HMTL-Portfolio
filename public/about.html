<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Malakai Wensel,</p>

<p>I'm 21 and I aspire to be a web developer. I grew up in Texas around DFW, and from a young age my father introduced me to computers and coding.
    He himself worked for AT&T and now works for Amdocs as a senior IT manager. So obviously I picked up a interest in technology. 
    In middleschool through highshcool I self taught myself game development and made a couple mods but just didnt fully enjoy it. So I switched to HTML and wanted
    to learn web development and have just fell in love with it and I can't wait to learn more and  one day work for a company doing this.</p>
